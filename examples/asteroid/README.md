# Kataster

A single screen simple space shooter developped in Rust with Bevy and Rapier2d.

It will remain a simple demonstration game.

## Bugs

. TextureId(xxx) panics sometimes.

. Why State queue support multiple ? Order becomes important, and last is inpredictable ?
. SubState ?
. State exit despawn system
