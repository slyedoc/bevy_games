# Kataster
A single screen simple space shooter developped in Rust with Bevy and Rapier2d.

It will remain a simple demonstration game.



## Bugs
. TextureId(xxx) panics sometimes.


. Why State queue support multiple ? Order becomes important, and last is inpredictable ? 
. SubState ? 
. State exit despawn system
